Jeg fik gode indsigter herfra til workflow og til et javascript der var langt over mit daværende niveau!


Thanks! This is awsome! Way too quick for me, I have to constantly pause and backtrack to check if I got everything, and I often don't. But even though it is a difficult and long proces (I use aproximately 6 times the actual time, because I get lost and have to start from an earlier point) it is great. I can't do 0.5times speed because it makes me very sleepy (:

I love that I am working on something that I can actually use for something (: It is a great practise while i am reading up on javascript. I really-really-really like that you are showing the actual proces and workflow with errorfindings, mockup checking, googlesearchs and everything. Also love the occasional "yes!" when it actually works and motivational comments. So nice!
